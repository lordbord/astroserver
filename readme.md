# Hello, This is a test repo for a website I'm building.

I'm using Astro to build the website.

I'm using TailwindCSS for the styling.

I'm using TypeScript for the code.

I'm using a raspberry pi to host the website.

There's a couple of things I'm working on, feel free to contribute or suggest ideas :3

## TODO
- [ ] I'm working on a terminal emulator for the website.
- [ ] I'm working on a way to host the website on the raspberry pi.
